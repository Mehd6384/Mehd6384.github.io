In this setting I made the Idle, Run, Dash, various hits animations, including a headbutt. In parallel, I was setting up the controller, using my previously detailed insights (see my previous post on 2.5D controller). One

# Axe stuff 

* Axe behaviour 
* Separate rig 
* Try to go with enums instead of list of bools
