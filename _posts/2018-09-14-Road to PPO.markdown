# The Road to PPO. Part II: Converting a famous implementation to a simpler one 


* Famous implementations from reseachers are usually designed to be as general as possible 
* Which is annoying when you're trying to make it fit your specific needs 
* In the way of making a personal, specific and modular implementation, my first step was to strip the implemtation to its bare minimum 
* In the translating part, most problems came from hidden in plain sight classes (Monitor, Visdom)

* Still to figure out the working part
